This project is going to use a React coded front end accessing a FastAPI backend, for visualizing and interacting with microscopy datasets.


This project will eventually be hosted on a docker image in google cloud, and will access a SQL database for the images. During this development phase the app will be local, with a frontend and backend. Once that works it will be migrated to the google cloud.
